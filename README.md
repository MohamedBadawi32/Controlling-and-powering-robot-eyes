# Description and Instructions
The purpose of this project is to design eyes for a robot that is capable to be powered by 4V to 12V. The eyes are represented by red LEDs and controlled by a switch that opens the circuit if the eyes are desired to be off and vice versa. The design consists of two main parts which are a voltage regulator and the LEDs. The voltage regulator uses the Zener diode simple principle; however, a transistor is added to authorize more current to flow. Additionally, the capacitors are used to stabilize and filter the signal. Regarding the eyes design, a parallel connection was picked over the series to prevent any voltage division or a breakage in the circuit. Most importantly, the resistors, which are connected in series with the LEDs, are to minimize the current through the LEDs since the maximum current an LED could handle is 20 mA and a minimum of 5 mA. Hence, the resistors must be matched at values between 50 to 200 ohms to avoid any current division or not maintaining the working region of the LEDs.

*The recommended rates of input voltages and resistance MUST NOT BE EXCEEDED!*
